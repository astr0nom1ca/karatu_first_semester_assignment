        <h2>Biography</h2>
        My name is Oghenerukevwe Jeffrey Onemu and my AltSchool ID is: <code>ALT/SOE/024/0167</code>. I consider myself a very visual person. My early interests revolved around a
fascination with the illustrations in cartoons and books , an eventual progression to
recreating them and later on, making up my own illustrations. However, over time I
lost interest in pursuing visual arts professionally and chose computer science as my
course of study mostly because I felt that every other field was becoming a branch of
computer science due to the far reaching applications of computer technology. My experience with programming has been rich and varied and it began in my second
year of university when I had to write a C++ program to calculate Lagrange
interpolation, a mathematical formula used to generate polynomials. I found the
experience enlightening and highly fulfilling as prior to that assignment, I considered
programming to be some unattainable skill and was frankly uninterested in it all
together. However, being able to apply programming to solving a real world problem
put it in a whole new light for me. This event would be what formally drew me into
the world of programming and it’s many possibilities. From a surface level foray into online communities, I gleaned that Python was one of
the less intimidating languages around which would lead me to various online
tutorials and finally, a Sololearn course. The knowledge I acquired through
independent learning came in handy during my third year when several of my courses
required Python. It also put me far ahead of the required coursework and served as
added motivation to pursue more knowledge. Since then, I have gained a strong
understanding of HTML, responsive web design, PHP and Django through online
courses. These courses made me much more aware of the front end engineering aspects of
web development as well as the thought that goes into designs and the skill it takes to
execute it. I now find myself silently rating websites by how easy they are to use, how
well they display information, how attractive they are as a whole etc. This has
increasingly led me to become re-interested in the visual arts. The only difference
being that when I see a design I like now, I automatically wonder how something
similar can be implemented on a web page.
